## The Vulgar Script: The Strange Alliance Against Open AI

There is a strange alliance forming in the world of technology.

Usually, the open-source "hacker" community and the corporate "suits" of Big Tech are natural enemies. One wants information to be free; the other wants to monetize it. They disagree on privacy, on capitalism, and on open standards.

But on the topic of AI, they have found common ground. Both are aggressively arguing that powerful models should not be in the hands of the general public.

The hackers hate AI because it produces "slop", flooding the web with low-quality code and art that degrades the craft. The corporations and researchers argue for censorship and closed access, insisting that the technology is too unsafe for public distribution.

Despite the different slogans, their goal is identical: exclusion. They both believe that the machinery of intelligence is too dangerous, or too pure, to be entrusted to the commoner.

This is a recurring historical pattern. Whenever a technology appears that democratizes a capability, the incumbent elites try to lock the door. And if you look at history, the societies that succeed in locking that door don't end up safe. They end up destroying themselves.

For centuries, the "keys" to civilization were protected by a barrier of artificial complexity.

In the West, it was Latin. In the East, it was Chinese characters.

The Chinese system was particularly effective at exclusion. As a logographic system with no alphabet, it was structurally inefficient, requiring you to memorize thousands upon thousands of unique shapes by rote to read and write.

This inefficiency was the point. It acted as a filter. It ensured that only the aristocracy, who had the leisure time for decades of study, could become literate. It created a society where a tiny sliver of elites held a monopoly on reality, while the vast majority were kept in the dark.

When "vulgar scripts" appeared to challenge this, like the printing press in Europe or phonetic scripts like Hangul in Asia, the reaction was always hostile. The elites argued that simplifying the script would degrade the culture.

Here, the world split into two paths.

In the West, the gatekeepers lost. The Reformation forced the vulgar languages into the mainstream. The result was immediate chaos: religious wars, heresy, and noise. But the long-term result was the Enlightenment, the Scientific Revolution, and the modern world. The "noise" was the sound of civilization scaling up.

In the East, the gatekeepers won. The aristocracy successfully marginalized the vulgar scripts. They kept the high culture pure and locked away in the complex characters.

They thought this made them safe. They thought that by keeping the masses uneducated, they were maintaining order.

In reality, they were creating a catastrophic vulnerability.

By hoarding literacy, the Eastern elites created a massive, uneducated underclass. The population was not just poor; they were intellectually disarmed. Because they were locked out of the intellectual conversation, they had no "immunity" to bad ideas.

When the 20th century arrived, this vacuum was filled by the most brutal forms of demagoguery.

The result was the Cultural Revolution. The masses didn't just reject the elites; they slaughtered them. Because they had been kept ignorant, they were easily manipulated into believing that their suffering was caused by the very existence of culture. They burned books, destroyed temples, and starved in the millions.

The elites had spent centuries protecting their culture from the "vulgar" masses, only to ensure its violent destruction by a mob that was too uneducated to know what they were destroying.

We are standing at the same fork in the road today.

When Big Tech preaches "AI Safety," they are advocating for the **intellectual disarmament** of the public. They want to keep the models closed, accessible only through their sanitized APIs. They want to remain the High Priests of the new intelligence.

When the hacker community mocks AI "slop," they are playing the role of the aesthetic snob, disgusted by the messy sound of the masses learning to speak.

They should be careful.

A world where only a few corporations possess super-intelligence is not safe. It is a tyranny waiting to happen. It creates a class of modern Mandarins with a monopoly on the truth, and a vast, "unarmed" underclass that can be manipulated at scale.

If you treat the public like children who cannot be trusted with sharp objects, you do not get a safe society. You get a society of children—easily tricked, easily angered, and utterly incapable of defending themselves.

The "slop" is annoying. But the alternative is the silence of the graveyard. Better to arm the population and deal with the noise, than to disarm them and wait for the explosion.
